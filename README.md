🎯 **[Live Demo](https://dragonworks.dev/ngx-dashboard/)** - Try the interactive demo application

Modern Angular libraries for building drag-and-drop grid dashboards with resizable cells and customizable widgets. Built with Angular 22+ standalone components, NgRx Signals state management, and Material Design 3 design system compliance.

**ngx-dashboard** provides drop-in dashboard functionality for Angular applications. Add interactive grid-based dashboards to existing apps or build dedicated dashboard experiences from scratch. The library handles multiple dashboards within a single application, supports programmatic creation and serialization for persistent storage, and includes a built-in editor for end-user dashboard customization.

Opinionated with flexibility:

- **Explicit grid resolution**: Each dashboard has a row/column grid (8×16 by default) that you set when creating it and can change at runtime through the grid geometry API or the editor's drag handles. Cells resize responsively within that grid, but the layout never reflows itself across breakpoints — for different orientations, create separate dashboard configurations (16×8 for landscape, 8×16 for portrait).
- **Customization**: The library follows Material Design 3 patterns and includes standard Angular i18n support, while allowing customization through MD3 design tokens and dependency injection providers for dialogs, menus, and persistence strategies.

**ngx-dashboard-widgets** provides example widgets to illustrate concepts. Any Angular component can become a dashboard widget by implementing a simple interface and registering with the dashboard service. Widgets must be fully responsive and handle all cell sizes gracefully.

The **demo application** showcases the libraries in action with practical examples. It demonstrates dashboard management with FAB controls, drag-and-drop widget installation, real-time theme switching, custom widget implementations (Sparkline, Sparkbar, Temperature, Realtime Gauge), and both localStorage and file-based persistence strategies.

## 📦 Architecture

This workspace contains three main projects:

### [@dragonworks/ngx-dashboard](./projects/ngx-dashboard)

Core dashboard library providing the fundamental grid and widget management system:

- **Grid System** - Responsive drag-and-drop grid with collision detection and boundary constraints
- **Copy Gestures** - Holding `Ctrl`/`Cmd`/`Alt` while dragging a widget drops an independent copy carrying the widget's live state; holding it while dragging a resize handle tiles the swept area with copies. Rebindable per dashboard with `copyDragModifiers`
- **Grid Geometry API** - Rows, columns, and gutter settable at runtime, with clamp-to-content resizing that never orphans a widget
- **Cell Components** - Cells resizable on both axes (right, bottom, and corner handles) with live preview, context menus, and dual flat/elevated appearance modes
- **Cell Selection** - Optional snap-to-grid rectangle selection with modifier-key gating, a click-vs-drag threshold, and pointer support for mouse, touch, and pen
- **Widget Palette** - Collapsible widget groups, an opt-in search box, and optional per-cell name badges for reading a crowded grid
- **Widget Family Shared State** - Configuration shared across every instance of a widget type, serialized alongside the dashboard ([detailed docs](docs/widget-shared-state-guide.md))
- **Extensible Provider System** - Dependency injection-based architecture enabling custom dialog and UI implementations ([detailed docs](docs/provider-system-architecture.md))
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback for unknown widget types with state preservation, a swappable error view for withheld or not-yet-loaded widgets, and self-healing in both directions as types register and unregister ([detailed docs](docs/widget-system-architecture.md#unresolved-widget-types))

### [@dragonworks/ngx-dashboard-widgets](./projects/ngx-dashboard-widgets)

Widget collection library implementing Material Design 3 patterns:

- **Arrow Widget** - Directional indicators with rotation, opacity, and background customization
- **Label Widget** - Text display with responsive sizing using canvas-based optimization
- **Clock Widget** - Analog/digital dual-mode clock with real-time updates, configurable formats, and second hand options
- **Radial Gauge Widget** - Semi-circular gauge with a passive/active display system and MD3-compliant styling
- **Radial Gauge Component** - Standalone SVG gauge with dynamic sizing, segment support, and SVG-native text scaling, usable outside a dashboard
- **Responsive Text Directive** - Automatic font scaling with ellipsis-free design and developer-friendly API

### [Demo Application](./projects/demo)

Interactive demonstration showcasing real-world usage patterns:

- **Dashboard Management** - FAB speed dial controls with auto-loading from JSON configuration
- **Grid Settings** - Reference implementation of the grid geometry API, with rows, columns, and gutter editable at runtime
- **Theme System** - Material Design 3 theming with live theme switching and color token extraction
- **Widget Gallery** - Drag-and-drop widget installation from a grouped, searchable palette
- **Custom Widgets** - Sparkline and Sparkbar charts with theme-responsive colors, a Temperature widget demonstrating shared state, and a Realtime Gauge built by composition
- **Custom Error Views** - A board of three cells whose widget types are all missing: `UNKNOWN_WIDGET_RESOLVER` answers with a "withheld" view, a "module not loaded" view, and the library's own default. Each type can be registered and unregistered to watch its cell heal in place
- **Selection & Zoom** - Rectangle selection driving a non-destructive zoom into a minimal bounding box
- **Persistence** - localStorage and file system persistence implementations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Core dashboard
npm install @dragonworks/ngx-dashboard

# Widget collection (optional)
npm install @dragonworks/ngx-dashboard-widgets

# Material Design support
npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk
```

### Versioning

The libraries maintain major version parity with Angular. While major versions are aligned, minor and patch versions may differ.

For example:

- Angular 22.x.x → ngx-dashboard 22.y.z
- Angular 23.x.x → ngx-dashboard 23.y.z

This ensures compatibility with your Angular version while allowing independent feature releases and bug fixes.

### Usage Guide

For complete setup instructions, implementation examples, and best practices, see our comprehensive **[Usage Guide](USAGE.md)**.

The usage guide includes:

- **Complete Setup** - App configuration, Material theming, and widget registration
- **Dashboard Implementation** - Component usage patterns from the demo app
- **Custom Widget Creation** - Step-by-step widget development guide
- **Advanced Features** - Persistence, context menus, and custom dialogs
- **Troubleshooting** - Common setup issues and solutions

Quick example for getting started:

```typescript
// app.config.ts - Register widgets on startup
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideEnvironmentInitializer(() => {
      const dashboardService = inject(DashboardService);
      dashboardService.registerWidgetType(LabelWidgetComponent);
    }),
  ],
};
```
